## Tips for Best Results
*   **Midjourney:** Add params like `--ar 1:1` for icon and `--ar 2:1` for banner. Use `--v 6.0` for best realism.
*   **DALL-E:** If it generates text poorly, ask it to "generate the image without text" and add the text yourself in Canva/Photoshop later (this is often cleaner).
